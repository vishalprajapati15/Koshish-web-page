In 2018, KOSHISH established a library with resources for exams like Boards and competitive tests. The initiative also provides financial aid to needy students and teaches music, art, and experiments. Along with academics, it instills discipline, punctuality, and moral values while raising awareness of social issues. Volunteers visit homes to better understand the studentsâ€™ challenges and support their holistic development. </div>
